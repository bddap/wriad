# Wriad

Welcome to Wriad, a tool that uses a language model to transform selected text in your text editor. With Wraid, you can step back and refactor text by issuing high level commands.

## (future) Usage

To use Wraid, highlight the text you want to transform and enter a transformation command in natural language. Wraid will then edit the selected text according to your command.

Here are some examples of transformation commands:

- "Turn this into a command line program that accepts `a` and `b` as arguments, printing the result"
- "Add a legend explaining what each acronym stands for"
- "Make it clear, make it concise, make it flow"
